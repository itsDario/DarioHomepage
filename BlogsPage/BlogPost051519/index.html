      <img src="/BlogsPage/BlogPost051519/images/FaxJsLogo.png" id='FaxJSLogo' alt="">
      Then a year later they made the original version of react for facebooks ads. Also in 2012 they acquired instagram.
      Instagram wanted to use facebook's new library for their site so Pete Hunt another employee of facebook started
      working on making react standalone and open source.</p>

    <p>In 2013 Jordan Walke released an early version of React to the world. People where very skeptical and allot of
      people thought it was much worse then what's already available. Although in time where able to convince people
      about the potential of react.</p>
    <p>In 2014 react started growing. The react developers started targeting larger companies by talking about the
      stability of react. They also started react conferences around the world to gain more fans. Developers started
      making more tools that work with React like ReactiveX and and React Host loader. This year react started expanding
      quite a bit.</p>
    <p>The first stable version of react and the react developer tools released in 2015. More companies started adopting
      react like netflix and airbnb. This year facebook released the first version of react native for ios and android.
      A few more great tools that work with react where released like Redux, Relay, and GraphQL and every year after
      that there are always new tools that work with react.</p>
