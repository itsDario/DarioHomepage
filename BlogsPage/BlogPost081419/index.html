      Many code Challenges would have you manipulating arrays or other kinds of datasets in various ways. The easy
      solution which would be using nested loops iteration through all the data multiple times is very inefficient and
      would cause you to fail your code challenge even if the correct answer is found. A much faster solution is to keep
      track of the data on your first iteration using a hash and then it's much faster to return the solution. In this
      post i will not go into the specifics about algorithms ill just guide you through one specific code challenge and
      show you how a hash can solve the problem
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post I will use a recent code challenge i completed as an example and show you how it's much faster to
      solve the problem. Here is the description of the code challenge i received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given an array that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first duplicate number for
      which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1 duplicated numbers,
      return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second occurrence of the other
      number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first solution was to just iterate through all the numbers using two loops and checking the index to find the
      number that fits the requirements of the challenge. That failed the challenge because it was very slow. I was
      looping through the whole array again for each number in the array. Which took a very long time for the computer
      to finish compared to other solutions. I wont display that code since its not ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution that I submitted which passed the code challenge used hash to record the data on my first passthrough
      and i can return the answer without having to iterate through the data multiple times here is my submitted code
      with comments
    </p>
    <code>
      <p>function firstDuplicate(a) {</p>
      <p> var nums = {} //Create Hash</p>
      <p>var answer = -1 //Create answer with -1</p>
      <p>a.some(n => { //iterate through the array</p>
      <p>if(nums[n] === undefined){ //Make sure the value of the entry is not undefined</p>
      <p>nums[n] = 0 //use 0 so we can count up</p>
      <p>}</p>
      <p>nums[n]++ //count each time the value repeats</p>
      <br>
      <p>if(nums[n] > 1 && answer &lt; 0){ //check if any of the items in the array have met the requirements return</p>
      <p>answer=n //exit the array. Works when sing ‘some’ instead of ‘foreach’ } }) return answer //return the answer }
      </p>
    </code>
    <p>
      Here you can see Using Hashes you don't have to keep looping over the same dataset which will save a lot of
      computer time, especially on larger arrays but more importantly will help you pass coding challenges.I wish you
      luck in your future challenges.
