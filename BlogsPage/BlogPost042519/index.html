    <h6>042519</h6>
    <br>
    <p>There are plenty of javascript libraries to choose from they each have their own use with their own pros and
      cons. Today I want to talk about p5. P5 is based around the idea being easy to pick up. Its not the most powerful
      javascript library but its very quick to get started and making some animations.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples here to show some of what P5 can do. <a
        href="https://p5js.org/examples/">https://p5js.org/examples/</a></p>

    <p>Setting up P5 is like any other JS library to include it into your project you just gotta link it in your header.
      Either include it the file locally or place a link to the CDN you can find either link here <a
        href="https://p5js.org/get-started/">https://p5js.org/get-started/</a> </p>
    <p> Then in your JS file you just need a setup and update method in normal javascript.</p>
    <h4>function setup() {</h4>
    <h4>}</h4>
    <h4>function draw() {</h4>
    <h4>}</h4>
    <p>The setup method is run once at the start of the program and the update method is run continuously.
      In the update is where the main parts of your program will go. </p>
    <p>P5 brings plenty of methods for you to use. Most of them are simplified to single words like the ellipse and rect
      methods where you just need to say the method name, size, and location on screen. You can see all the included
      functions on their site here <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">https://p5js.org/reference/</a>
      You can also use plenty of extra libraries for p5 to do things like interacting with the Dom or adding other kinds
      of inputs instead of the default. <a href="https://p5js.org/libraries/">https://p5js.org/libraries/</a> They also
      have a webeditor where you can test out a few methods quickly <a

    <p>You can check out a game I made before over here <a
