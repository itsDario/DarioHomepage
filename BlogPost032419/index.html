    <p>The first one on my list is called max_by. This method can be called on an array of objects and then it would
      sort the array in alphabetical or numerical order based on the object property of your choice. Then it returns the
      highest value or last string of the sorted array.</p>

    <p>Here is an example to illustrate what max_by does.</p>

    <h3>[“Dario”, “Cantaloupe”, “Apple”].max_by{ |object| object.length}</h3>

    <p>Here we pass an array of words and it max_by will return “Cantaloupe”
      The array of three words was sorted by the length and we got back the longest word</p>

    <p>If we ran the line of code with just the object without asking for the length like this</p>

    <h3>[“Dario”, “Cantaloupe”, “Apple”].max_by{ |object| object}</h3>

    <p>We would get back “Dario” since it has the last letter if the array was sorted alphabetically. But if we are just
      sorting by string names or just numbers alone then we could use the method called max like this</p>

    <h3>[“Dario”, “Cantaloupe”, “Apple”].max()</h3>

    <p>And it would also return “Dario” since it works in the same way but without taking a block.</p>
    <p> Other methods you can use to accomplish similar tasks are called</p>
    <h3>min</h3>
    <h3>min_by</h3>
    <h3>sort</h3>
    <h3>sort_by</h3>
    <p>They work in almost the same ways and ideally you use the one that is the simplest for your work</p>
    <p>Also you can find an example at</p>
