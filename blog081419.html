							Many code Challenges would have you manipulating arrays or other kinds of datasets in
							various ways. The easy
							solution which would be using nested loops iteration through all the data multiple times is
							very inefficient and
							would cause you to fail your code challenge even if the correct answer is found. A much
							faster solution is to keep
							track of the data on your first iteration using a hash and then it's much faster to return
							the solution. In this
							post i will not go into the specifics about algorithms ill just guide you through one
							specific code challenge and
							show you how a hash can solve the problem
						</p>
						<p>
							In this post I will use a recent code challenge i completed as an example and show you how
							it's much faster to
							solve the problem. Here is the description of the code challenge i received.
						</p>
						<p>
							Given an array that contains only numbers in the range from 1 to a.length, find the first
							duplicate number for
							which the second occurrence has the minimal index. In other words, if there are more than 1
							duplicated numbers,
							return the number for which the second occurrence has a smaller index than the second
							occurrence of the other
							number does. If there are no such elements, return -1.
						</p>
						<p>
							My first solution was to just iterate through all the numbers using two loops and checking
							the index to find the
							number that fits the requirements of the challenge. That failed the challenge because it was
							very slow. I was
							looping through the whole array again for each number in the array. Which took a very long
							time for the computer
							to finish compared to other solutions. I wont display that code since its not ideal.
						</p>
						<p>
							The solution that I submitted which passed the code challenge used hash to record the data
							on my first passthrough
							and i can return the answer without having to iterate through the data multiple times here
							is my submitted code
							with comments
						</p>
						<pre><code>function firstDuplicate(a) {

	var nums = {} //Create Hash
	var answer = -1 //Create answer with -1

	a.some(n => { //iterate through the array
		if(nums[n] === undefined){ //Make sure the value of the entry is not undefined
			nums[n] = 0 //use 0 so we can count up
		}

		nums[n]++ //count each time the value repeats
		if(nums[n] > 1 && answer &lt; 0){ //check if any of the items in the array have met the requirements 
			return answer = n //exit the array. Works when using ‘some’ instead of ‘foreach’ 
		} 
	}) 
	return answer //return the answer 
}</code></pre>
						<p>
							Here you can see Using Hashes you don't have to keep looping over the same dataset which
							will save a lot of
							computer time, especially on larger arrays but more importantly will help you pass coding
							challenges.I wish you
							luck in your future challenges.
