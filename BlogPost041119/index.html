    <h6>041119</h6>
    <br>
    <p>CSS animations are a simple and fun way to add a bit of life to your website. They are quick to implement and
      today i'll be covering how to use keyframes to help you make any animation. There are two parts to an animations.
      The
      animation properties and the keyframes.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/itsDario/09z4ntow/29/">https://jsfiddle.net/itsDario/09z4ntow/29/</a>

    <p>Here are a few animation properties you can use to put into your css</p>
    <h3>animation-name: example;</h3>

    <p>This sets how long your animation plays</p>
    <h3>animation-duration: 4s;</h3>

    <p>This sets how many times you play your animation. It can be set to Infinite</p>
    <h3>animation-iteration-count: 5;</h3>

    <p>This is how long you want the animation to wait before starting up
      It also accepts negative numbers which makes the animation start midway through</p>
    <h3>animation-delay: 2s;</h3>

    <p>There are a few more animations properties you can learn about here</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp</a>


    <p>With keyframes you enter three things. The percent into the animation you want the event to occur, the property
      you
      want changed and the value of the property</p>
    <h3>@keyframes example {</h3>
    <h3>0% {background-color:red;}</h3>
    <h3>50% {background-color:blue;}</h3>
    <h3>100% {background-color:red;}</h3>
    <h3>}</h3>
    <p>This animation will move the background back and forth between red and blue.
      Feel free to play around the the settings in the jsFiddle! I wish you luck with your future CSS animations</p>
